# WorkDayScheduler
This app allows users to schedule and place information in a 9-5 time slot. The user is greeted with a page with buttons to edit the corresponding input as well as save the information typed into the corresponding input. The information placed in the slots are saved to local storage and can be retrieved on page load. The time slot will turn red if the time is not within the correct hour and turn green if the time is within the correct hour.
